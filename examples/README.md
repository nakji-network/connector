# Example Connectors
The example is composed of two connectors: 
* Ethereum Connector
* Compound Connector

To build a connector based on Ethereum, you can choose to use `EthereumConnector` from `github.com/nakji-network/connector/chain/ethereum` or
only to embed `nakji connector` into your connector and implement other functionalities as you see fit.
