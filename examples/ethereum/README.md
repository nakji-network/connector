# Ethereum Connector

## Ethereum
Ethereum is open access to digital money and data-friendly services for everyone â€“ no matter your background or location. It's a community-built technology behind the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) and thousands of applications you can use today.

## How to run
This connector requires Kafka to be running, and a config.yaml file containing Kafka endpoints and Ethereum RPC endpoints.
