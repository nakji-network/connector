This is a library to help anyone integrate a new data source (aka connector) with [Nakji Network](https://nakji.network).

Ideas: 


The library should deal with:

config
- Config from centralized place. Can get global config values as well as connector specific values

message queue
- Kafka Producer / Consumer, kafka utils
- stream names, topic names

monitor

manifest
- Prints diagnostic info / monitor based on manifest.yaml

examples

proto
- Prints protobufs? Register proto types
